    <h1>About Us</h1><br />
    <h3>We are a business that specializes in rims of different kinds. We can help determine and estimate the price of a rim with specific<br />
    sizes and details of the rim of your choice. We plan on growing our business from what we have now with the few rims that we<br />
    have and growing to make and estimate all kinds of rims. We are currently working with three rims and can tell how much they<br />
    cost based on sizes and styles that you choose but will work on having more.</h3>
